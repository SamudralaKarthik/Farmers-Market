# Farmers-Market
The main approach of this project is to design a website that helps the farmers to sell their products directly to the consumers. Farmer’s markets encourage individual associations and obligations of shared advantages between farmers, shoppers, and communities. The earlier way of selling the products is different.  The farmer gives all the products to some companies or sellers so that they get less income. So, by this website the farmer can make money and consumers can get a better product.
 
This website reduced as much as possible to avoid all the errors while entering the data. This also shows an error message while entering an invalid id. Any zero-knowledged person can also use this website for their purpose. By this, we can say that this website is user-friendly to the users. Farmer’s market website as discussed above is secure, fresh, and easily accessible. Thus, it will help to purchase the products that are produced by farmers directly.
